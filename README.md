# About this project 🚀
A `calorie tracker` with the color theme of orange and pink (a coral color). There are two inputs, one where you write what type of food or meal it is and the other is how many calories it has in it. After that you press the plus button and it will be added below the gray line at the bottom. You can delete or change something inside by pressing gear that is at the far right. Above the inputs you see the total sum of how many calories you have taken in. A button to delete everything at once is at the top right that says "Clear All". Everything is stored in Local Storage, if you delete something, it will be romved from local storage.

Note: <i> I actually did not do this project entirely myself, but I did it with a course (the course i followed along with: https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/?referralCode=F3249B20C1BBE85EFEEC), and learned a lot from it. I built my own design on this project: Calorie Tracker. </i>
